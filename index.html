        <p><em><strong>English Teacher</strong></em></p>
        <p>I am a hard working teacher who works at an independent school, where I apply my teaching experience along with my organization, motivation, and communication skills. I strive to yield students who can touch the future. I accommodate
          myself to the different learning styles and levels of intelligences by diversifying the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic strategies to meet the needs of all the students. I make sure to have an active classroom by keeping the students on
          task and allowing them to participate and share their own ideas instead of just treating them like receptacles or pawns. Motivation is a must to foster the capabilities of the students, and hence their creativity and critical thinking will
          be nurtured.</p>
